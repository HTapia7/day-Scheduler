# Work Day Scheduler 

* When I open the planner THEN, I am displayed with current day 

* WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event

* WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
